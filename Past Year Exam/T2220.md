## Question 1
1. Construct a truth table to determine whether $(p \to q) \wedge \neg q  \leftrightarrow \neg p$ is a contingency, contradiction, or tautology.
2. Use the logical equivalence laws to show $\neg (p \to \neg q) \vee (\neg r \to q)$ and $q \vee r$ are logically equivalent.
3. Use rules of inference to show that $\forall x (P(x) \to R(x) \wedge Q(x)) \wedge \forall x (\neg P(x) \to T(x)) \wedge \exists x(\neg R(x)) \Rightarrow \exists x(T(x))$.
4. Use mathematical induction to prove that for all integers $n \ge 1$, $2+4+6+...+2n = n^{2} + n$

## Question 2
1. Let A be a set of vowels in the English alphabet and B = {x|x is a letter from the word "MOUNTAIN"}.
    1. List out the unique elements of sets A and B.
    2. Find $A \Delta B$.
    3. Find $P(B-A)$.
2. Suppose S is a relation on Z that S = {(a, b)| $a + b \ge 2$ }. Is S symmetric? Justify your answer.
3. Let $f:Z^+ → Z, f(x) = 2x^2+2$. Is f one-to-one? Justify your answer.
4. Show that $g(x) = 3xlnx + 2x^2$ is $O(x^2)$.
